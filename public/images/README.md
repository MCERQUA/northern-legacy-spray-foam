- Will be served exactly as-is
- Need to be referenced by URL path

## Usage Example:

```astro
<!-- In any .astro file -->
<img src="/images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description" />

<!-- In React components -->
<img src="/images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description" />
```

## Supported Formats:
